## 🚀 About Me

I started out in tech from a slightly different angle—coming from a commerce background, I jumped into Cloud Security and worked on securing cloud environments. But along the way, I got pulled into the world of software development—curious about *how* things are built, not just how they’re protected.

Today, I’m building full-stack applications using the **MERN stack**, with a focus on clean architecture, secure APIs, and great UI/UX. My security mindset still plays a big role—I always think about scalability, best practices, and clean code.

Currently looking for developer opportunities where I can build, grow, and contribute to awesome teams 🚀
